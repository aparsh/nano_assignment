# PH401 Nano Assignment

### Question 1
#### To deduce the total number of atoms and surface atoms for the different shells of cuboctahedral/spherical shape. Plot % of atoms in bulk/surface versus particle size. The user should get the idea to generate the thickness or size of nanoparticle for a particular application (optical/electrical/magnetic/strength)

You can run the code locally or can find the live demo [here](https://aparsh.github.io/nano_assignment/).
The app deals with both the cuboctahedral and spherical shape and for all the applications namely optical ,electrical, magnetic, strength.

# Steps to run the code locally 
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
